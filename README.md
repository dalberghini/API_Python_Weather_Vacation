This plot shows us that during the winter months, when this data was taken the max temperature was higher in the negative latitudes, also known as the south hemisphere. This is because of the tilt of the Earth. During the winter months the northern hemisphere is further away from the Sun and the southern hemisphere is closer, so the northern hemisphere is colder and receives less direct sunlight when compared to the southern hemisphere.
The humidity clusters to not look highly correlated to the latitude. It appears that there are heavy clusters around the equator and a lack of clustering near the poles. This is likely due to the intense cold. Humidity in the air will freeze at high enough temparutes and turn to snow quicker in extreme cold.
The cloudiness ratings show us clustering together. This shows us cloud masses moving and being connected to each other. Meteorology tells us that cloud mass move along warm and cold fronts. As the temperature fronts move in they bring clouds with them. This causes a large area of the planet to have 0 cloudiness at a given time, with higher levels of cloudiness moving through latitudes together.wind speed plot shows us that low levels of wind is what was is recorded on a given day. Wind is created by high and low pressure pockets and those are not everywhere at once. The atmosphere is homogenous solution of gas molecules, so wind levels should be low if there is no stimuli.
